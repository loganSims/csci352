  This file holds every function used for
  btree manipulation. Including saving nodes, accessing nodes,
  inserting, deleting, as well as functions for building the
  Data struct. (the struct that holds information about inverntory
  items)

btree.h:
  Structs for the btree are defined here as well as the order
  of the btree.

loadbtree.c:
  This program takes an inventory file and
  loads the btree using functions from btree.c
  The btree will be saved in a file called btreedata.txt.

updatebtree.c:
  This program takes a transaction file and applies the
  included transactions to the btree, saving the results
  and displaying a sales report for the months worth
  of transactions.

readbtree.c:
  This program prints out the btree. It displays information
  about each node and the data it holds, as well as the children
  of the node. The data is display as an in-order traversal. This
  program was used for debugging and validating the btree structure.
